Welcome to our project on predicting BTC/USD prices using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model!ðŸ“ˆ This project demonstrates how we leverage machine learning for time series forecasting and deploy models using MLflow and Amazon SageMaker.ðŸš€

## Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to predict the future price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) using historical data and real-time updates from the CryptoCompare API. The ARIMA model was selected for its performance in training and testing phases.


## Setup AWS CLI configuration

We followed the setup instructions detailed in [this repository](https://github.com/vb100/deploy-ml-mlflow-aws/blob/main/README.md), which provided comprehensive guidance on configuring AWS CLI for seamless integration with MLflow and Amazon SageMaker.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Training the Model with MLflow**

   Run `train.py` to initiate training and track experiments with MLflow. This generates the `MLflow` folder containing experiment logs and artifacts, including the trained model.

2. **Building and Pushing Docker Image**

   Using the artifacts from MLflow, build a Docker image containing the trained model(go to the artifact directory):
   
   ```bash
   mlflow sagemaker build-and-push-container 

  After, check AWS ECR repos list to get the image URI.

3. **Deploy image to Sagemaker**
 Run `arimadeploy.py` to ddeploy image to Sagemaker

4. **Store fetched btc data to a s3 bucket**
 Run `fetch_bucket.py` store a csv file from btc fetched data into a s3 bucket

5. **Retrain the model if it's necesary**
 Run `test_model.py` to predict in base of the data stored in the s3 bucket. If the R2 score is less than 0.80 the model it's retrained and saved as a new version into s3.
